ðŸš€ This repository is my journey through the "100 Days of Swift" program, originally created by Paul Hudson from Hacking with Swift. The program is designed to help learners become proficient in Swift programming language over the course of 100 days by completing various projects and challenges.

## About the Program
"100 Days of Swift" is an educational initiative aimed at anyone interested in learning Swift programming language or improving their existing skills. The program covers a wide range of topics, including basic syntax, data types, control flow, functions, closures, object-oriented programming, and more.

Throughout the program, participants work on daily coding challenges, projects, and exercises provided by Paul Hudson. These challenges gradually increase in complexity, allowing learners to build upon their knowledge and skills each day.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository contains my solutions, projects, and progress logs for each day of the "100 Days of Swift" program. Each day's work is organized into separate folders, named according to the day number.
