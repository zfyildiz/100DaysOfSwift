/* variables
 Variables: allow us to store temporary information in our program,
 and form a key part of almost every Swift program. */

var greeting = "Hello, playground"

/*Once you create a variable using var, you can change it
 as often as you want without using var again. For example:*/

var favoriteShow = "Orange is the New Black"
favoriteShow = "The Good Place"
favoriteShow = "Doctor Who"

/* Strings & Integers
 Swift is what’s known as a type-safe language, which means that every variable must
 be of one specific type. The str variable that Xcode created for us holds a string of
 letters that spell “Hello, playground”,so Swift assigns it the type String.*/

var stringValue = "Hello, playground"

//On the other hand, if we want to store someone’s age we might make a variable like this:
var age = 38
//That holds a whole number, so Swift assigns the type Int – short for “integer”.

var population = 8_000_000 // this don’t change the number but do make it easier to read
